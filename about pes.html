       <h4>ABOUT PES</h4>
      <p>
Pro Evolution Soccer (PES), now rebranded as eFootball, is a series of association football simulation video games developed and published by Konami. The series has been a staple in the football gaming community, known for its realistic gameplay, detailed player models, and for having licensed teams and leagues, although it has historically had fewer licenses than its main competitor, FIFA by Electronic Arts.

PES has been acclaimed for its emphasis on tactical play and realistic soccer simulation. It allows players to implement complex strategies, control the pace of the match, and use the unique skills of their players to influence the outcome of games. Over the years, it has introduced various modes such as Master League (a career mode), MyClub (similar to FIFA's Ultimate Team), and local and online multiplayer matches.

In 2020, Konami announced a major shift in the franchise's direction by rebranding PES to eFootball and moving towards a digital-first, free-to-play model. This transition was aimed at leveraging new technologies to enhance the gaming experience and expand the series' audience. The rebranding also came with a shift towards a more online-focused gameplay experience, aiming to create a platform that could host esports competitions and regular updates more seamlessly.

Despite the rebranding and changes in its distribution model, the core appeal of the game remains its dedication to creating a realistic, tactical football experience that rewards player skill and strategy. The series has a loyal fan base and continues to be a significant player in the sports gaming genre.</p>
