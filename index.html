                         <h1>PES TUTORIALS</h1>   <h2>Welcome To PES</h2> 
 
        <p>PES refers to "Pro Evolution Soccer," a series of association football simulation video games developed and published by Konami. The series has been known for its realistic gameplay, detailed player models, and licensed teams. It has been a competitor to EA Sports' FIFA series. Starting from 2021, Konami rebranded PES as "eFootball" with a focus on digital and online play, aiming to transition the game into a free-to-play model. This change was part of Konami's strategy to compete in the digital gaming space more effectively and cater to a broader audience by leveraging new technologies and gaming trends.</P>

When you open the PES mobile app (now known as eFootball PES or simply eFootball following its rebranding), the home screen you're greeted with is designed to provide easy access to the game's various features, modes, and updates. While the specific elements can vary over time due to updates and seasonal changes, here is a general overview of what you might find on the home screen:

    <section>
    <ul>
            <li><b>Play Match:</b>This is usually a prominent button that allows you      to quickly start playing matches. It might include options for local matches, online multiplayer, or quick matches against AI.</li>
