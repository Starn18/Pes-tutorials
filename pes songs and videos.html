     <p>The song titles and music tracks featured in PES mobile games (now known as eFootball PES) can vary significantly with each edition, as Konami updates the soundtrack annually to keep the game fresh and engaging. The soundtrack typically includes a mix of international artists across various genres, aiming to appeal to a global audience. However, without specifying a particular year or version of the game, it's challenging to list exact song titles because the soundtrack changes with each update.</p>

    <p>Konami has been known to include tracks from genres like rock, pop, electronic, and hip-hop, featuring both well-known and emerging artists. The music plays in the background during menu navigation, team selection, and at certain points within the game, adding to the overall experience of playing.</p>

<p>For the most accurate and up-to-date information about the songs featured in a specific version of eFootball PES, you would typically check the game's official website, forums, or community pages where updates and soundtrack listings are often shared by the developers or the game's community.</p>
